%The \textit{proceedings} are the records of a conference.\footnote{This
%  is a footnote}  ACM seeks
%to give these conference by-products a uniform, high-quality
%appearance.  To do this, ACM has some rigid requirements for the
%format of the proceedings documents: there is a specified format
%(balanced double columns), a specified set of fonts (Arial or
%Helvetica and Times Roman) in certain specified sizes, a specified
%live area, centered on the page, specified size of margins, specified
%column width and gutter size.

\section{Change of Coordinate Matrix in \texorpdfstring{$ \GL_n(\Z_2) $}{GL\_{}n(Z\_{}2)}}

\subsection{Change of Coordinate Matrix}
we need theorem of linear algebra. Following notation and theorem in \cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

\begin{theorem} \label{theorem:changeOfBasis}
Let $ \B $ and $ \B^\prime $ be two ordered bases for a finite-dimensional vector space $ V $,
and let $ Q = \left[ \1_V \right]_{\B}^{\B^\prime} $. Then
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $ Q $ is invertible.
    \item For any $ v \in V, \left[ v \right]_{\B^\prime} = Q \left[ v \right]_{\B} $.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

Observe that if $ \B = \left\{ u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n \right\} $
and $ \B^\prime = \left\{ u_1^\prime, u_2^\prime, \ldots, u_n^\prime \right\} $,
then
\[ u_j = \sum_{i=1}^{n} { Q_{ij} u_i^\prime } \] for $ j = 1, 2, \ldots, n $,
which implies the $ j $-th column of $ Q $ is $ [ u_j ]_{\B^\prime} $ and $ Q $ changes $ \B $-coordinates into $ \B^\prime $-coordinates.

\begin{definition}
The matrix $ Q = \left[ \1_V \right]_{\B}^{\B^\prime} $
defined in Theorem \ref{theorem:changeOfBasis} is called a \textit{change of coordinate matrix}.
\end{definition}

In this paper, we consider a problem based on binary representation.
This means that each solution of the problem belongs to the vector space $ \Z_2^n $,
where $ n $ is the problem size.
The following is an example of the one-max problem applying a change of basis.
Here, the one-max problem is to find a vector with a value of $ 1 $ for each element.

Let $ \B $ and $ \B^\prime $ be two ordered bases for the one-max problem with problem size of $ 3 $.
The baese are as follows:
\begin{align*}
    \B         &= \{ (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) \} = \{ e_1,        e_2,        e_3 \}, \\
    \B^\prime  &= \{ (1,0,1), (0,0,1), (0,1,0) \} = \{ e_1^\prime, e_2^\prime, e_3^\prime \}.
\end{align*}
Note that
\begin{align*}
    \1_V(e_1) &= 1 \cdot e_1^\prime + 1 \cdot e_2^\prime + 0 \cdot e_3^\prime \\
    \1_V(e_2) &= 0 \cdot e_1^\prime + 0 \cdot e_2^\prime + 1 \cdot e_3^\prime \\
    \1_V(e_3) &= 0 \cdot e_1^\prime + 1 \cdot e_2^\prime + 0 \cdot e_3^\prime.
\end{align*}
Hence, matrix $ Q = \left[ \1_V \right]_{\B}^{\B^\prime} $ as follows:
\[
    Q = \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 \\
        1 & 0 & 1 \\
        0 & 1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The elements of the one-max problem based on the standard basis are shown in Table \ref{tab:one-max} for each element.

    Let $ A \in M_{n \times n}(\Z_2) $. Any one of the following two operations on the rows of $ A $ is called an elementary rwo operation:

        \item Interchaning any two rows of $ A $ and
        \item Adding a row of $ A $ to another row.
    \end{enumerate}

    For each $ i,\, j,\, k $ such that $ i \neq j,\, j \neq k, \text{and } k \neq i $ the following five exchange rules hold. \\

    \item $ S_n^{ij} A_n^{ki} = A_n^{kj} S_n^{ij} $, and

Conclusions


%\section{The Body of The Paper}
%Typically, the body of a paper is organized into a hierarchical
%structure, with numbered or unnumbered headings for sections,
%subsections, sub-subsections, and even smaller sections.  The command
%\texttt{{\char'134}section} that precedes this paragraph is part of
%such a hierarchy.\footnote{This is a footnote.} \LaTeX\ handles the
%numbering and placement of these headings for you, when you use the
%appropriate heading commands around the titles of the headings.  If
%you want a sub-subsection or smaller part to be unnumbered in your
%output, simply append an asterisk to the command name.  Examples of
%both numbered and unnumbered headings will appear throughout the
%balance of this sample document.
%
%Because the entire article is contained in the \textbf{document}
%environment, you can indicate the start of a new paragraph with a
%blank line in your input file; that is why this sentence forms a
%separate paragraph.
%
%\subsection{Type Changes and {\itshape Special} Characters}
%
%We have already seen several typeface changes in this sample.  You can
%indicate italicized words or phrases in your text with the command
%\texttt{{\char'134}textit}; emboldening with the command
%\texttt{{\char'134}textbf} and typewriter-style (for instance, for
%computer code) with \texttt{{\char'134}texttt}.  But remember, you do
%not have to indicate typestyle changes when such changes are part of
%the \textit{structural} elements of your article; for instance, the
%heading of this subsection will be in a sans serif\footnote{Another
%  footnote here.  Let's make this a rather long one to see how it
%  looks.} typeface, but that is handled by the document class file.
%Take care with the use of\footnote{Another footnote.}  the
%curly braces in typeface changes; they mark the beginning and end of
%the text that is to be in the different typeface.
%
%You can use whatever symbols, accented characters, or non-English
%characters you need anywhere in your document; you can find a complete
%list of what is available in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}
%\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.
%
%\subsection{Math Equations}
%You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
%inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of
%the three are discussed in the next sections.
%
%\subsubsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
%A formula that appears in the running text is called an
%inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
%\textbf{math} environment, which can be
%invoked with the usual \texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end}
%construction or with the short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You
%can use any of the symbols and structures,
%from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
%\LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a
%few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how
%this equation:
%\begin{math}
%  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
%\end{math},
%set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
%set in display style.  (See next section).
%
%\subsubsection{Display Equations}
%A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
%text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
%environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
%\textbf{displaymath} environment.
%
%Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
%and structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just
%give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
%First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:
%\begin{equation}
%  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
%\end{equation}
%Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
%the \textbf{displaymath}
%environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
%\begin{displaymath}
%  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1
%\end{displaymath}
%and follow it with another numbered equation:
%\begin{equation}
%  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
%\end{equation}
%just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.
%
%\subsection{Citations}
%Citations to articles~\cite{bowman:reasoning,
%clark:pct, braams:babel, herlihy:methodology},
%conference proceedings~\cite{clark:pct} or maybe
%books \cite{Lamport:LaTeX, salas:calculus} listed
%in the Bibliography section of your
%article will occur throughout the text of your article.
%You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography;
%you simply need to insert one of several citation commands with
%a key of the item cited in the proper location in
%the \texttt{.tex} file~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.
%The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely
%identify each work; in this sample document, the key is
%the first author's surname and a
%word from the title.  This identifying key is included
%with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file for your article.
%
%The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file
%are beyond the scope of this sample document, but more
%information can be found in the \textit{Author's Guide},
%and exhaustive details in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's
%Guide} by Lamport~\shortcite{Lamport:LaTeX}.
%
%This article shows only the plainest form
%of the citation command, using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.
%
%Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an enumerated
%journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire issue \cite{JCohen96},
%a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
%\cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation \cite{Editor00}
%followed by the same example, however we only output the series if the volume number is given
%\cite{Editor00a} (so Editor00a's series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.),
%a chapter in a divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a divisible book
%in a series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as book \cite{Knuth97},
%an article in a proceedings (of a conference, symposium, workshop for example)
%(paginated proceedings article) \cite{Andler79}, a proceedings article
%with all possible elements \cite{Smith10}, an example of an enumerated
%proceedings article \cite{VanGundy07},
%an informally published work \cite{Harel78}, a doctoral dissertation \cite{Clarkson85},
%a master's thesis: \cite{anisi03}, an online document / world wide web
%resource \cite{Thornburg01, Ablamowicz07, Poker06}, a video game (Case 1) \cite{Obama08} and (Case 2) \cite{Novak03}
%and \cite{Lee05} and (Case 3) a patent \cite{JoeScientist001},
%work accepted for publication \cite{rous08}, 'YYYYb'-test for prolific author
%\cite{SaeediMEJ10} and \cite{SaeediJETC10}. Other cites might contain
%'duplicate' DOI and URLs (some SIAM articles) \cite{Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}.

%
%
%\subsection{Tables}
%Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
%placement for them is typically the top of the page
%nearest their initial cite.  To
%ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
%environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
%the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
%in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
%be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
%horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
%on \textbf{tabular} material
%are found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.
%
%Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
%Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
%placement of the table here with the table in the printed
%output of this document.
%
%\begin{table}
%  \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
%  \label{tab:freq}
%  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
%    \toprule
%    Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
%    \midrule
%    \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
%    $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
%    \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
%    $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
%  \bottomrule
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}
%
%To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
%live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
%contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
%wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more desirable.
%Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
%Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
%instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
%in the printed output of this document.
%
%
%\begin{table*}
%  \caption{Some Typical Commands}
%  \label{tab:commands}
%  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
%    \toprule
%    Command &A Number & Comments\\
%    \midrule
%    \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
%    \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
%    \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
%    \bottomrule
%  \end{tabular}
%\end{table*}
%% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!
%
%It is strongly recommended to use the package booktabs~\cite{Fear05}
%and follow its main principles of typography with respect to tables:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Never, ever use vertical rules.
%\item Never use double rules.
%\end{enumerate}
%It is also a good idea not to overuse horizontal rules.
%
%
%\subsection{Figures}
%
%Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the best placement
%for them is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest their
%initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of
%figures, use the environment \textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and
%its caption.
%
%This sample document contains examples of \texttt{.eps} files to be
%displayable with \LaTeX.  If you work with pdf\LaTeX, use files in the
%\texttt{.pdf} format.  Note that most modern \TeX\ systems will convert
%\texttt{.eps} to \texttt{.pdf} for you on the fly.  More details on
%each of these are found in the \textit{Author's Guide}.

%\caption{A sample black and white graphic
%that has been resized with the \texttt{includegraphics} command.}
%\end{figure}
%
%
%As was the case with tables, you may want a figure that spans two
%columns.  To do this, and still to ensure proper ``floating''
%placement of tables, use the environment \textbf{figure*} to enclose
%the figure and its caption.  And don't forget to end the environment
%with \textbf{figure*}, not \textbf{figure}!

%
%\subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
%
%Other common constructs that may occur in your article are the forms
%for logical constructs like theorems, axioms, corollaries and proofs.
%ACM uses two types of these constructs:  theorem-like and
%definition-like.
%
%Here is a theorem:
%\begin{theorem}
%  Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
%  an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
%  \begin{displaymath}
%    \int^b_af(t)\,dt = G(b) - G(a).
%  \end{displaymath}
%\end{theorem}
%
%Here is a definition:
%\begin{definition}
%  If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
%  unique number that has
%  logarithm $z$:
%  \begin{displaymath}
%    \log e^z = z.
%  \end{displaymath}
%\end{definition}
%
%The pre-defined theorem-like constructs are \textbf{theorem},
%\textbf{conjecture}, \textbf{proposition}, \textbf{lemma} and
%\textbf{corollary}.  The pre-defined de\-fi\-ni\-ti\-on-like constructs are
%\textbf{example} and \textbf{definition}.  You can add your own
%constructs using the \textsl{amsthm} interface~\cite{Amsthm15}.  The
%styles used in the \verb|\theoremstyle| command are \textbf{acmplain}
%and \textbf{acmdefinition}.
%
%Another construct is \textbf{proof}, for example,
%
%\begin{proof}
%  Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
%  \begin{displaymath}
%    \lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
%  \end{displaymath}
%  Then
%  \begin{displaymath}
%    l=\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)
%    = \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
%    \left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ]
%    = \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
%    \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0\cdot L = 0,
%  \end{displaymath}
%  which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
%\end{proof}
%
%\section{Conclusions}
%This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
%Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
%Appendices; brief samples of these
%follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
%we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
%of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
%this paper are to articles which have nothing to
%do with the present subject and are used as
%examples only.

\section{Headings in Appendices}
The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
%the body of the article are different in the appendices.
%In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
%\textbf{section} is used to
%indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
%designation (i.e., the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
%a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
%hierarchical structure
%\textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
%highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
